## Running the Provided Example

1. Unzip narpFortran.zip.
2. Run narpFortran.exe in the unzipped folder.
3. Click the **load from output** button, then select the **OUTPUT** sample file provided in the software package. The software will automatically parse the sample **OUTPUT file** and display it.
4. Alternatively, click **select folder from input files** to choose the *root* folder from the package as the input folder, and click **select folder from output files** to choose the *root* folder as the output folder. Finally, click the **RUN** button. The software will run for a while to simulate (1~2 minutes), automatically parse the output files, and display them.

## Running Custom Files

1. Unzip narpFortran.zip.
2. Run narpFortran.exe in the unzipped folder.
3. Click the **select folder from input files** button to select your custom folder as the input folder. The folder should contain only three files: LEEI, INPUTA, and INPUTB. For specific file formats, please refer to the paper.
4. Click the **select folder from output files** button to select your custom folder as the output folder. Ensure the output folder is empty.
5. Click the **RUN** button. The software will simulate for a while (1~2 minutes). The simulation's output files will be saved in your custom output folder, after which the software will automatically parse the output files (specifically the main output file **OUTPUT**) and display them.
6. If you wish to load data from an existing output file, click the **load from output** button, then select your **OUTPUT** sample file. The software will automatically parse the sample **OUTPUT file** and display it.
